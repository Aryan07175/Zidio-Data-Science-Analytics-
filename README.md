# Zidio-Data-Science-Analytics(Internship)
our First task is:
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction using Time Series Forecasting
This project is a collaborative effort by a team of seven students focused on time series analysis and forecasting for stock market prediction. Our aim is to leverage statistical models and machine learning techniques to understand stock trends and make future price predictions more interpretable and data-driven.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To analyze historical stock market data using time series models like:

ARIMA/SARIMA

Prophet

LSTM

Hybrid and ensemble methods

And to forecast stock prices while evaluating:

Seasonality and trends

Volatility and patterns

Model performance using RMSE, MAPE, etc.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Tools
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras

Jupyter Notebooks

Git & GitHub for collaboration

ðŸ“Š Dataset
We are using publicly available stock price datasets (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle) that include:

Daily open/close prices

High/low

Volume

ðŸš€ Deliverables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model comparison dashboard

Interactive forecasting plots

Documentation of approach and insights

Final notebook/report and presentation

Let me know if youâ€™d like to include:

A link to the dataset

A project timeline or roadmap

Role-wise division of work among members

Badges for tools/tech used (for enhanced visual appeal on GitHub)
